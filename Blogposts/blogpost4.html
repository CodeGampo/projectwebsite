            <p>
                Pitch day, in week two of the course, could be described as a presentation practice moment and peer
                feedback session. The goal was to provide feedback to three other
                students and receive a post-it provided by a teacher or teachers’ assistant. Below is the yellow post-it
                given to me by
                one of the assistant teachers. The post-it reads: Profile list, JavaScript, Blog, Poster, Folders. At
                the time of the feedback,
                I had progressed already far in completing the website.
            </p>
            <div class="postit">
                <img src="../Photos/feedback assistant teacher.jpg" alt="Feedback post-it">
            </div>
            <p>
                Above I have placed the list given by the assistant teacher.
                The profile list comment refers to my issues with getting the profile pages’ lists to line up properly.
                The JavaScript refers to my progress with JavaScript in the dashboard page which I am very proud of
                after following many tutorials!
                Blog refers to missing content which still needed to be added at the time. This was because I ran out of
                time to add it, so I made it look as I wanted it using Lorem Ipsum.
                The poster comment refers to the unfortunate fact that at the time of feedback day I did not have a
                poster prepared.
                Due to me joining this study somewhat late I ran into some time constraints leading up to the feedback
                moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The folders comment is telling me to make folders for my different files of my website. For the feedback
                day I had all my files in one folder (main repository),
                this at the beginning of building the website seemed proper until it started to get out of control with
                the images and all the different pages.
                Though I did not know at the time how to reference a file on a different folder, so I left it. Now the
                folders have all been implemented properly into all the pages and all the links have been updated.
                I did run into some major problems with Git trying to push my progress, turns out I accidentally
                implemented a submodule into one of my new folders and pushed it,
                it had the same name as some other files which confused the system (I think). The issue has been
                resolved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now with the feedback given by the TA fully implemented into the code I will now highlight below what
                were the notable features given feedback on during pitch day by my fellow students.
            </p>
            <header>
                <h2>First feedback from </h2>
            </header>
            <div class="feedbackform-container">
                <img src="../Photos/firstfeedback-front.jpg" alt="First feedback form front-side">
                <img src="../Photos/firstfeedback-back.jpg" alt="First feedback form back-side">
            </div>
            <p>
                This student acknowledged that all the necessary pages were provided but felt that I needed to structure
                my
                project better by using folders and noted that some of the text wasn’t big enough and make it hard to
                read.
            </p>
            <header>
                <h2>Second feedback from </h2>
            </header>
            <div class="feedbackform-container">
                <img src="../Photos/secondfeedback-front.jpg" alt="Second feedback form front-side">
                <img src="../Photos/secondfeedback-back.jpg" alt="Second feedback form back-side">
            </div>
            <p>
                The second student provided a bit more feedback noting some very key aspects of the website and helping
                me
                thoroughly with a new extension in Visual Code Studio named Beautify. Furthermore, her noted that I
                needed to:
            </p>
            <div class="feedback-list">
            <ul>
                <li>Add motivation</li>
                <li>Improve text size</li>
                <li>Profile list to center, or move them on the same line.</li>
                <li>Make footer more visible</li>
                <li>Make styles per page</li>
                <li>Folders</li>
                <li>Rename home.html to index.html</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                This student helped me tremendously, mostly with understanding that I needed to expand my styles layout. 
                I find that now it is way easier to work with using a reset.css, sharedstyles.css and a separate styles 
                file per webpage accept blogposts. When he added the beautify extension, I really liked it at first however I quickly 
                found that it is unsupported since there are now native solutions to formatting which I now happily use. 
            </p>
            <header>
                <h2>Third feedback from </h2>
            </header>
            <div class="feedbackform-container">
                <img src="../Photos/thirdfeedback-front.jpg" alt="Third feedback form front-side">
                <img src="../Photos/thirdfeedback-back.jpg" alt="Third feedback form back-side">
            </div>
            <p>
                Unfortunately this student did not write any feedback on that form and so I find it hard to remember what was 
                said, this can be taken as a reminder to also take notes at a feedback “receiver” during feedback moments like this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am very happy with the feedback I received, it was all very constructive and thoughtful.
                I also learned a lot and was guided by fellow students with some of my technical issues.
                All in all, I am very happy with my website in its current state and can’t wait to present it for a
                grade!
