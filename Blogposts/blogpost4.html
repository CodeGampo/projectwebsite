<h1>   Blog post 4 - First feedback</h1>

    Unfortunately, at the time of writing this blog post I have lost the three forms with the feedback provided by the students on pitch day half-way through the module. 
    However, I do still have the yellow post-its given to me by one of the assistant teachers. The post-it reads: Profile list, JavaScript, Blog, Poster, Folders. 
    At the time of the feedback, I had progressed already far in completing the website
</p>
    <div class="postit">

</div>
<p>
    Above I have placed the list given by the assistant teacher.
    The profile list comment refers to my issues with getting the profile pages’ lists to line up properly. 
    Fellow students suggested me to make a separate “.css” file for each webpage. Doing this fixed my issue. 
    The JavaScript refers to my progress with JavaScript in the dashboard page which I am very proud of after following many tutorials! 
    Blog refers to missing content which still needed to be added at the time. This was because I ran out of time to add it, so I made it look as I wanted it using Lorem Ipsum. 
    The poster comment refers to the unfortunate fact that at the time of feedback day I did not have a poster prepared. 
    Due to me joining this study somewhat late I ran into some time constraints leading up to the feedback moment. 
</p>
<p>
    The folders comment is telling me to make folders for my different files of my website. For the feedback day I had all my files in one folder (main repository), 
    this at the beginning of building the website seemed proper until it started to get out of control with the images and all the different pages. 
    Though I did not know at the time how to reference a file on a different folder, so I left it. Now the folders have all been implemented properly into all the pages and all the links have been updated. 
    I did run into some major problems with Git trying to push my progress, turns out I accidentally implemented a submodule into one of my new folders and pushed it, 
    it had the same name as some other files which confused the system (I think). The issue has been resolved. 
</p>
<p>
    Overall, I was very happy with the feedback I received, it was all very constructive and thoughtful. 
    I also learned a lot and was guided by fellow students with some of my technical issues. 
    All in all, I am very happy with my website in its current state and can’t wait to present it for a grade!
