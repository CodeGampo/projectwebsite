            <p>
                As outlined in my profile page I switched my studies from Water-management to ICT. This has to do with
                many circumstances, but I have thought long and hard about my study choice.
                I do not have any coding experience, but I do have a lot of experience with computers and so deem myself
                capable.
                The water-management study was chosen because I have also been very interested in geography and how
                nature works,
                my overall goal being making an impact on climate change and understanding different nature systems.

                So, it seems going from becoming a water manger and biologist to a ICT professional is a unconventional
                step,
                however given my history with computers I considered it. My now ex-girlfriend is a Mid-level software
                engineer,
                and I watched her work for the better part of two years. At first I did not thbink anything of it but in
                hindsight
                I can now see that this has also impacted my decision to pursue this study. I still very much have
                contact with her
                and can consult her with any issues I could run into with git and html.
