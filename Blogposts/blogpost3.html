    As briefly touched on before, I consider myself experienced  on a amateur level with computers and software. 
    I consider myself an adventurous person and I tend to also bring this over onto the internet. I started my 
    adventures on a PC which when Minecraft just came out couldn’t even run it. I remember that it prompted that 
    I needed a video card capable of something mine wasn’t but after some googling I downloaded this very risky 
    software from a website called Softonic which allowed me to play the game even though it was at 5 FPS… </p>

    I would have to be around 11 years old when that happened. I am now more than double that age and I have got 
    to say I am much better at problem solving on my computer. The first games I really started modding were the 
    GTA games (San Andreas and Liberty City). I even had a phase of downloading cheats on games like Battlefield 
    Heroes and TF2, just because I wanted to see how easy/hard it was to get it. It was very easy and not rewarding 
    at all since it completely defeats the purpose of an online game like a shooter.

    In the water management study, we were also asked to learn QGIS and ARCGIS. These are mapping software, and they 
    are used around the world to illustrate map and gather data geographically. This I enjoyed a lot, now, while 
    starting to make some progress with this website, I have already ran into my fair share of issues. This process 
    I am very much enjoying so far though and I look forward to learning more in the future!
