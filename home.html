        <h2>Hey!</h2>
        <p class="home-text">My name is Sebastiaan Demmers and welcome to my website! Born and raised in Amsterdam I decided to move to Middelburg to study for the fact it would be more realistic to find an apartment here.
        Inititally I wanted to study Water Management however that did not go as well as I wanted(more on this on the profile page(link))
        This is my first ever attempt at coding anything, so I have a lot to learn.
        On the other hand, since I have had a computer from the age of 11 years old I think I will be fast to understand how to code while at the same time having fun with it!.</p>
        <p class="home-text">I am excited to learn and share my progress! This website is intended to give the reader a basic understanding about who I am and what my motivation is to study ICT! The website will for now contain a Home page(current),
             Profile, Dashboard, FAQ and a Blog with multiple different posts!</p>
