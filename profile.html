            <p class="profile-text">I'm someone who's always been passionate about learning
                new things. After spending two years studying water management, I was given an
                NBSA. This meant I had to find another study for this year or wait a year to try
                again. As my interests have been in tech for a really big portion of my life
                already I decided to make the switch to ICTâ€”and so for I am loving every moment.
                Though my journey so far has been anything but linear I can say with pride that
                I took four gap years to travel the world and experience many different
                cultures, which really broadened my perspective on life. To be able to travel
                all those years, I spent a lot of time working in Horeca of Amsterdam, where I
                learned valuable skills like communication and adaptability that have helped me
                in both my personal and professional life.</p>
            <p class="profile-text">When I'm not diving into a new project or learning
                something new, you can usually find me hanging out with friends, playing video
                games, or making music with my electric drums. Whether through gaming, music,
                studying or traveling, I appreciate a good balance in life with all the other
                interests that make me who I am!
