                    After switching my studies from Water Management to ICT after careful consideration, 
                    despite having no coding experience but a strong background with computers. 
                    My initial goal was to impact climate change, I now see a path forward in the tech field.

                    Star Citizen is one of the most ambitious and highly anticipated video games of all time. The game aims to provide players with an immersive experience in a massive,
                    persistent universe where they can explore, trade, fight, and build their own careers.
                     To achieve this, the developers have been working on two critical technologies, namely serving meshing and persistent entity streaming.

                    I've considered myself an computer enthusiast for a long time, starting with  experiments like downloading software to run Minecraft on an underpowered PC when I was 11. Over the years,
                    Iâ€™ve improved my problem-solving skills, from modding GTA games to learning mapping software like QGIS and ARCGIS during my Water Management studies. 
                    Now, as I navigate challenges in building a website, I'm enjoying the learning process and eager to gain more knowledge.

                    With the notes from an assistant teacher, I improved various aspects of my website. Feedback included fixing CSS issues by creating separate files, adding missing blog 
                    content, organizing files into folders, my progression with JavaScript, like dealing with Git issues and time constraints, I found the feedback constructive, learned a 
                    lot from fellow students, and am proud of the website's current state, ready to present it for grading.

                    Technological inventions have dramatically shaped human history, from the printing press enabling widespread literacy to the steam engine driving industrialization. Key breakthroughs include the light bulb,
                    which extended working hours and economic growth, and the telephone, which revolutionized communication and laid the groundwork for modern telephony. The airplane transformed global travel and commerce, 
                    while personal computers, evolving from transistors and microprocessors, revolutionized work, information processing, and home computing.
